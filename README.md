# Boilerplate with Webpack as bundler  

### Set Up  

Create a project directory and download Webpack 3:  
```bash
npm install -g webpack@3.11.0--save-dev  
```

Initialize a node project with:   

```bash
npm init
```  

This should give you a package.json.  Since webdev-boilderplate has a package.json already, just run:  

```bash
npm install to install all dependencies  
```
